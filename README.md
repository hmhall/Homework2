The project includes two scenes; one for each part of the assignment

Part A:
The scene includes an object with a rim shader that detects where the normals are parallel to the camera and colors them cyan. This effect displays through other objects, creating an x-ray effect. The scene also includes a bloom effect on the camera.
Controls: 
-Press right arrow to move to Part B
-Press space bar to JEFF BRIDGES, showcasing the rim shader's x-ray property.

Part B:
This scene includes a vertex displacement shader that creates a height map from a given image's rgb values. It also includes a shader that reflects the cubemapped skybox, resembling a liquid.
Controls:
-WASD to move
-Mouse to look around
-Press left arrow to move to part A
-Press 1, 2, or 3 to change whether the height map is determined by the images red, green, or blue values, respectively
-Press Q to raise the "sea level," and E to lower it
-Press R to raise the opacity of the "water," and F to lower it
